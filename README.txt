Easily manage and display client testimonials on your website.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to easily manage and display client testimonials on your website by adding a new 'Testimonials' custom post type and custom taxonomy for categorizing testimonials.

You can display testimonials anywhere on your website using the `[ajv_testimonials]` shortcode or the included 'Testimonials' widget. You can also use the 'Insert Testimonials' button in the page editor to automatically add the shortcode to your page or post content.

The shortcode accepts two optional parameters, `category` and `class`. You can specify which categories you want displayed by entering the slug for each category separated by a comma, and add custom CSS classes by separating each with a space.

The following example shows how you can implement the shortcode on your website:

`[ajv_testimonials category="cat1,cat2,cat3" class="class1 class2"]`
